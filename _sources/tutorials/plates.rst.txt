Plate Notation
==============
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the plate notation in DagSim to represent replicated nodes.
If you are not familiar with using DagSim, please see :ref:`Specifying a simulation` for a general overview of the framework, and :ref:`Quickstart` for examples on how to use the framework.


The `plate notation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation>`_ is a template-based representation language that allows for a convenient and compact way of representing nodes that are replicated in the graph. Instead of defining and drawing a node (that should be replicated) multiple times, you define that node once and encapsulate it inside a rectangle (thus the name plate).

For example, the two graphs below are equivalent, where the plate on the left hand side is replicated three times to unfold as the graph on the right hand side:

.. image:: ../_static/images/tutorials/plates.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

In DagSim, you specify the name of the plate in which a node resides, if any, and the number of replications of each plate in the graph. You can have as many plates as you want in the graph, though currently, a node can only reside in one plate.

The following are examples of how to exactly do this in Python and YAML.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Python
    In Python code, you add a :code:`plates` argument to the node definition and give it the name of the plate in which that node resides, and then in the definition of the graph, you specify the number of replications of each plate in the graph, in the form of a dictionary of (plate_name:number_of_replications) key-value pairs, as shown in the following example:

    .. code-block:: python

        import dagsim.base as ds
        import numpy as np

        def add_noise(x):
            return x + np.random.normal()

        X = ds.Node("X", function=np.random.normal)
        Y = ds.Node("Y", function=add_noise, args=[X], plates=["plate1"])

        graph = ds.Graph([X,Y], plates_reps = {"plate1": 3})
        data = graph.simulate(10)

    By default, when you call the draw method on the graph, you will get the image view as the one on the left hand side above (which we call the folded view). To get the view as on the right hand side, you call draw method with the argument :code:`folded=False`:

    .. code-block:: python

        graph.draw(folded=False)

   .. tab:: YAML
    In YAML, you follow a very similar way of defining plates, specifying the plate in which each node lives, if any, and the number of replications of each node in the graph.
    You would specify the simulation above as follows:

    .. highlight:: yaml
    .. code-block:: yaml

        graph:
          python_file: functions_file.py # the path of the python file containing the definition of the add_noise function
          plates_reps:
            plate1: 3
          nodes:
            X:
              function: numpy.random.normal
            Y:
              function: add_noise(X)
              plates: plate1

        instructions:
          simulation:
            csv_name: plates_demo
            num_samples: 10

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
